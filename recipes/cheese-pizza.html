    <h2>The only cheese pizza recipe you'll ever need</h2>
    <p>This is the absolutely <strong>best</strong> cheese pizza recipe you've ever come across. I'm sure of it. The recipe's simple. The ingredients are simple. No need to reinvent the wheel. Once you make this pizza, you'll never need another recipe again.</p>
    <p>Below, we'll cover the ingredients you'll need for this delicious cheese pizza, along with the steps to actually chef it up.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package of store-bought pizza-dough.</li>
        <li>1 jar of store-bought pizza sauce.</li>
        <li>1 package of store-bought mozzerella cheese.</li>
        <li>1 container of store-bought powdered parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>1 bottle of extra-virgin olive oil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat your oven as high as it goes (ideally 500 degrees F). When cooking pizza, less time at higher temp will help achieve a crisper crust, avoid sogginess, and provide more even cooking.</li>
        <li>Place your pizza stone inside the oven, letting it pre-heat alongside the oven.</li>
        <li>Put your pizza dough in a bowl, and place it in a warm area while your oven pre-heats. This relaxes the gluten structure of the dough, making it easier to roll out.</li>
        <li>Once your oven's pre-heated, place some flour on your countertop and roll out the dough into the always classic, circle.</li>
        <li>Spread sauce onto your dough, making sure not to use too much.</li>
        <li>Place a generous amount of mozzerella cheese on the pizza, making sure there is even distribution.</li>
        <li>Dust the top of the pizza with parmesan</li>
        <li>Spread some olive oil on the crust, to help achieve ideal browning.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza stone from the oven and put the pizza on it. Immediately place back in the oven.</li>
        <li>Cook the pizza for whatever seems like a good amount of time. It won't take long. Probably less than 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, and slice into the triangles we all know and love.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
