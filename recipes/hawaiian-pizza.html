    <p>As always, check out all the ingredients you need and steps to chef up this delicious pizza pie below.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul id="unordered-list">
        <li>1 package of store-bought pizza-dough.</li>
        <li>1 jar of store-bought pizza sauce.</li>
        <li>1 package of store-bought mozzerella cheese.</li>
        <li>1 bottle of extra-virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>1 package of store-bought Canadian bacon.</li>
        <li>1 store-bought pineapple.</li>
        <li>3-4 jalapeno peppers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat your oven as high as it goes (ideally 500 degrees F). When cooking pizza, less time at higher temp will help achieve a crisper crust, avoid sogginess, and provide more even cooking.</li>
        <li>Place your pizza stone inside the oven, letting it pre-heat alongside the oven.</li>
        <li>Put your pizza dough in a bowl, and place it in a warm area while your oven pre-heats. This relaxes the gluten structure of the dough, making it easier to roll out.</li>
        <li>Once your oven's pre-heated, place some flour on your countertop and roll out the dough into the always classic, circle.</li>
        <li>Spread sauce onto your dough, making sure not to use too much.</li>
        <li>Place a generous amount of mozzerella cheese on the pizza, making sure there is even distribution.</li>
        <li>Slice several slices of Canadian bacon into 1 inch cubes. Apply generously to the top of the pizza.</li>
        <li>Slice the pineapple into one inch cubes. Place a generous amount to the top of the pizza.</li>
        <li>Enjoy some extra pineapple on the side. It's pineapple. It's delicious.</li>
        <li>Chop the jalapenos into fairly thin slices. Place them on the pizza.</li> 
        <li>Remove the pizza stone from the oven and put the pizza on it. Immediately place back in the oven.</li>
        <li>Cook the pizza for whatever seems like a good amount of time.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, and slice into the triangles we all know and love.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
