    <h2> The big one you've all been waiting for. Pepperoni.</h2>
    <p>Legend foretold it's comming. Ever since man created this illustrious combination, pepperoni and pizza have been combined in a collab that changed the pizza game forever. Behold, our humble entrant into salt, cured-meat heaven.</p>
    <p>As per usual, we've included the ingredients and steps you need to cobble together this epic flavor combination below.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul id="unordered-list">
        <li>1 package of store-bought pizza-dough.</li>
        <li>1 jar of store-bought pizza sauce.</li>
        <li>1 package of store-bought mozzerella cheese.</li>
        <li>1 container of store-bought powdered parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>1 bottle of extra-virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>1 package of old world (Italian-style) pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat your oven as high as it goes (ideally 500 degrees F). When cooking pizza, less time at higher temp will help achieve a crisper crust, avoid sogginess, and provide more even cooking.</li>
        <li>Place your pizza stone inside the oven, letting it pre-heat alongside the oven.</li>
        <li>Put your pizza dough in a bowl, and place it in a warm area while your oven pre-heats. This relaxes the gluten structure of the dough, making it easier to roll out.</li>
        <li>Once your oven's pre-heated, place some flour on your countertop and roll out the dough into the always classic, circle.</li>
        <li>Spread sauce onto your dough, making sure not to use too much.</li>
        <li>Place a generous amount of mozzerella cheese on the pizza, making sure there is even distribution.</li>
        <li>Place a generous amount of pepperonis on the pizza. Seriously, don't skimp here. Use more than you think you need, as the pepperonis will curl up into cups while cooking.</li>
        <li>Dust the top of the pizza with parmesan</li>
        <li>Spread some olive oil on the crust, to help achieve ideal browning.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza stone from the oven and put the pizza on it. Immediately place back in the oven.</li>
        <li>Cook the pizza for whatever seems like a good amount of time. It won't take long.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, and slice into the triangles we all know and love.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li> 
    </ol>
